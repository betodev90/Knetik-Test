1.) How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

    I was able to dedicate about 6 hours of development to the task 
    and one hour to analyze the best way to present myself according to the requirement. 

    I would have liked to apply TDD unit tests and integration using Karma and Jasmin 
    but devote the time to the presentation and comply with the requirement. 
    I also thought about adding to graph of reports by date of the devices and a graph of registry of filters.

2.) What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

    I chose Angular because have more experience working with him and I agree with philosophy about DEVELOP THROUGH ALL PLATFORMS. The latest version it is 6.1.8

    ...

    `code`

3.) How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
    Well I usually when I 'm track down a performance issue in production, I see in services logs AWS that allows us to verify parameters as a connection, 
    timeout response fo server, the status of the database, 
    codes of response http (200, 404, 500, 204, so on on).  

    And yes I have to do all the test about performance whe a project its released in production. 
    One a time when I was working in a website about news we had a issue in performance when It gave a terrible happening in my country as was the earthquake in 2016 
    and the website had many simultaneous visits over 20000 requests. 

    The plan was applied cache, improve queries in databse, segmenting articles related to that event at that time I didn't know AWS code suite how CodeCommit, 
    CodeBuild, CodePipeline, Elastik Beanstalk that make the start-up 
    process quicker and verify logs.


4.) How would you improve the Knetik APIs that you just used?

5.) Please describe yourself using JSON.
